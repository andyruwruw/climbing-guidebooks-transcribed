# Climbing Guidebooks Transcribed

These guidebooks were passed to me by friends, containing more routes and history than I could find online. For one reason or another these can't be purchased or aquired through traditional means.

To make this information available to more people, I've transcribed them to JSON for other guides or platforms to pull from.

These on their own are not guides, without the topo images and other context the information is harder to read. The goal is to use this data to add to existing apps or create new apps and guides.

I'd provide the PDFs, but I think it's best to draw the information from them. They tend to be scanned copies of used / marked printed guidebooks, some with pages missing or clearly unfinished editions of the author's guides.

I want to encourage the creation of new guides that will be clear and easy for new climbers to use, but retain the information provided.

I'm happy to add other guides from other areas people are from! My only policy for this repository is guidebooks that can't be purchased. Royalties should remain with the author, and providing their hard work for free isn't the intention of this repository.

If you are an author of one of these old guides and would like to have the transcription removed, contact me immediately and I'll see that done. If you don't want to remove it, contact me anyways, I want to learn more about these guides!
