        "The steeply overhanging, uber high off the deck front-side of the Meth Lab Boulder is typically the first formation to visually grab climbers off the road",
        "Walking in from the parking lot at mile point west to east the Lower Garden \"Old\" Access trailhead will be encountered first. If Fight Club, Undertow or Mini-Me are your aim, head up this first scramble, passing a too-short to climb Turtle in A Half Shell on the way with its distincitve crack splitting it. If your sights are set on Boys In the Woods, The Good V3 or Angry Grandma, continue past this first scramble to where Roadside Boulder and Toilet Bowl are easily visible with an easier trail entry. Many opt for the \"New\" trailhead simply for ease, especially if the ground is wet at all, as the \"Old\" access can be muddy and slippery."

And, as a walk-in this access still retains value. Parking here is unreasonable for the distance saved versus the consequence of losing climbing access to the Garden's many areas. En route to this acess point you will walk by Weigh Stop and Illegal Parking Wall.

        "Making your way to the Middle Garden you will be passing the parking lot Mile point 3.08, passing MS 210 (access road for Upper Garden) and parking at Mile point lot 3.3 or 3.4. Parking lot at 3.4 is not ideal, as it follows a sharp hair-turn, and is much smaller and less visible to on-coming logging trucks. The lot at mile 3.3 is larger, allows more space between the lot and the road and is the same walk length to Prince Alber and the entrance to the Middle Garden. Whether walking or driving, the head of Prince ALbert pokes up through the trees, with the Middle Garden Cliff-band looming over. Hop the roads ditch and scramble a hillside access in proximity to Prince ALber. A minor trail system presents around Prince ALber, but does not maintain or connect to other boulders of the Middle Garden. The Middle requires bushwhacking and in some cases boulder prep. Some boulders show signs of being climbed historically, but this area does not see the re-cleaning and coninuous climbing of the Lower Garden, or parts of the Upper."

A single switchback at the entry loops around the bottom of the Uppers. 100 or so feet after the road bends back to perpendicular with the road below a minor pullout on the right hand side, and a series of large cut stumps on both sides of the road indicate the start of trailheads to the right hand side. If you've travelled MS 210 to a fork in the road you've gone too far.
